# Benchmarking Pfam Domain Annotation Using the Closest Domain Instance Structure

This repository contains the scripts used to benchmark structure-based domain annotation. The benchmarking is based on the structural similarity between query proteins and Pfam seeds. You will find Jupyter Notebooks in the `scripts` directory.

Before running the Jupyter notebooks, make sure to download the necessary raw files. You can do so with the following commands:

```
wget https://zenodo.org/record/8335990/files/BenchmarkingPfamSDB.tar.gz
tar -xf BenchmarkingPfamSDB.tar.gz
```
